# 🎵 Husic – Hand Gesture Music System

## 📌 Project Overview

**Husic – Hand Gesture Music System** is a Python-based computer vision project that allows users to **play music using hand gestures** captured through a webcam. By detecting and interpreting hand movements in real time, the system maps different gestures to musical notes or chords, creating an interactive and touch-free music experience.

This project combines **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **Python** to bridge the gap between **computer vision and music**.

## 🚀 Features

* 🎥 Real-time hand tracking using webcam
* ✋ Gesture-based control of musical notes/chords
* 🎶 Interactive and touchless music generation
* ⚡ Fast and responsive gesture detection
* 🧠 Uses computer vision instead of physical instruments

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **OpenCV** – for video capture and image processing
* **MediaPipe** – for hand landmark detection
* **NumPy** – for numerical computations
